# Ed-Fi Transformations for Apache KafkaÂ® Connect

[Single Message Transformations
(SMTs)](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_transforms) for Apache
Kafka Connect.

## Transformations

See [the Kafka
documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_transforms) for
more details about configuring transformations on how to install transforms.

### `GenerateIndexFromDmsResource`

This transformation builds an index based on a group of values contained in the
body of the result, separated by $.

- `org.edfi.kafka.connect.transforms.GenerateIndexFromDmsResource`
  - works on values.

The transformation defines the following configurations:

- `field.name` - Comma separated list of fields to be included into building the
  Index. This fields will be separated by $ and will add `descriptor` at the end
  if resource is marked as such.

Here is an example of this transformation configuration:

```properties
transforms=GenerateIndexFromDmsResource
transforms.GenerateIndexFromDmsResource.type=org.edfi.kafka.connect.transforms.GenerateIndexFromDmsResource
transforms.GenerateIndexFromDmsResource.field.name=projectName,resourceVersion,resourceName
```

## Running transformations

### Prerequisites

- Install, if you don't have it, gradle version 7.2.4 according to the
  [installation guide](https://gradle.org/install/)
- To verify your installation, pen a console (or a Windows command prompt) and
run gradle -v to run gradle and display the version, e.g.: `> gradle -v` Result:

```none
------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 7.2.4
------------------------------------------------------------
```

- To run the transforms locally for the first time you need to build the
gradle-wrapper.jar. To generate it, run the following command, this will add the
gradle-wrapper.jar in the gradle\wrapper folder `> gradle wrapper`

### Tasks

This project includes a series of *gradle* tasks:

- `./gradlew build`: Compile code

- `./gradlew test`: Run unit tests

- `./gradlew installDist`: Creates a jar distributable file, located under
  `/build/install/ed-fi-kafka-connect-transforms/ed-fi-kafka-connect-transforms-{version}.jar`
